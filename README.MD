#### Objectives:
- Apply the knowledge and techniques acquired to date
- Creating a complex scene with different geometries, materials, textures and lights

#### Description:
The aim of this project is to create a scene that combines the different elements explored in previous classes. For this work you should use as a base the code that is provided in Moodle, which corresponds to an empty scene. You will later have to add some of the created objects previously.
